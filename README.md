## About Me

Welcome to my corner of GitHub, where the error logs are plentiful and the sarcasm is free.

I’m a former maintenance technician who decided that fixing broken code was more fun than fixing broken machines. Now I’m a full-time, self-taught backend developer and data specialist. My career path is a bit like my SQL queries: sometimes convoluted, but always gets the job done (eventually).

**Fun Fact:** I like programming so much, I do it instead of gaming. That’s right—my idea of “leveling up” is getting a script to finally run without exceptions.
